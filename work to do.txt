    - test case 1: basic agent communication (basic cvrp)
        - all customers must be served in one go
        - mra: receive request, ask for capacity, assign route
        - da: return capacity, receive route, execute the route (or store for later execution), notify the depot when came back

    - test case 2: demand exceed capacity (test favor item over distance)
        - mra: like test case 1, but now with unserved customer which will be stored
        - da: like test case 1
        - after solving the first round, the unserved customer will be taken to solved again and assign back to the das, which will store the new route and execute later

    - test case 3: with maximum distance
        - like test case 1, but now with max distance

    - test case 4: multiple request when das have not arrived back
        - combination of all the above test cases, but now mra store unserved nodes in a separate list, until reached 6 (or no more requests left), take out for processing (before process the next request)


final work:
- draw route for unserved customer data (turn unserved point to served point)
- test case demonstration
    - have some kind of drop-down list that let the user pick the test case they want to view
- allow input data (using json)
    - allow user to either
        - write json data directly on the website (customer data)
        - upload json file contain user data
        - the json method will override the current customer list

error:
    - the coordinate still 0
    - visualization for vehicles with multiple routes assigned is flawed
        - for the first route, it move as expected
        - when new routes be assigned, the icon just teleport to the depot position
    - analyze where the error could be and fix the problem
idea:
    - movement visual is update independently from the route visual
    - when receive results for unserved customer, just turn the dashed line to  a straight line and the x points to normal points
    - all routes must remain on the map except when the user decide to delete some customer nodes, then delete the lines that connect to that node
    - it seems like the result affect the movement visual


- customer id should append request id for unique identifier, since multiple request can have the same customer id, which may confuse the frontend
    - make sure the change is consistent between frontend and backend
- remove the fix for 0 coordinates again, add print statement to print the list that contain unserved nodes to the console (not the log) for debug
